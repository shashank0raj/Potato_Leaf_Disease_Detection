# Potato Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning
This project was developed as part of the AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning, under the TechSaksham initiative by Microsoft & SAP. The system leverages deep learning and computer vision to detect common potato leaf diseases (Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Features
✅ Deep Learning-Based Disease Classification using TensorFlow/Keras <br>
✅ Streamlit Web Interface for easy image upload and real-time predictions <br>
✅ Automated Model Download from Google Drive for execution <br>
✅ Supports Three Disease Categories – Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight <br>

## Installation and Execution
1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
   cd Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection
2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit Web App
   ```bash
   streamlit run web.py
4. Upload an Image and Predict <br>
   (i). Open the Streamlit interface in your browser.<br>
  (ii). Upload a potato leaf image.<br>
 (iii). Click Predict to classify the leaf condition.<br>
